### About my submission:
#### Source:
What I have coded are in `Code` folder. They includes 2 files:
1. `main.css`:
Again, this is a simple css file to initialize background color and text color
2. `main.js`:
This is the most important file, all the implementation of the database structure and the handling is done here.
I will describe the data structure and its handling in specific files below

And one `index.html` file outside. This is just a very small html file, used to display web pages by integrating `main.css` and `main javascript`.
